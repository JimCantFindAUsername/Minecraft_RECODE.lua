# Minecraft_RECODE.lua

I'm not gonna make this long, my friend likes Minecraft and told me to recode it... Which I guess is enough of a summary. 
This is Lua scripting instead of Java, and uses a game engine so it will probably be much less longer than the original game to code, considering Minecraft
has like 60,000+ lines of code....
